# Mass from Orbits

*Created for AST2002*

Mass from Orbits is a game where players manually take measurements from a simulation of our solar system in order to calculate masses of orbited bodies. If the orbiting body is significantly less massive than the orbited body, [the equation for this](http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~thompson/1101/lecture_orbits_gravity.html) is `M ≈ (4*π^2*a^3)/(G*P^2)`, where `P` is the period of the orbit, `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit, `M` is the mass of the orbited body, and `G` is the gravitational force constant, which is approximately equal to `6.7 × 10^(-11) (N*m^2)/(kg^2)`. Calculations will be scored based on accuracy to the true values for the Sun, Earth, and [Mars](https://mars.nasa.gov/all-about-mars/moons/summary/), using [data from NASA](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/). Orbits are approximated as circular, and diameters are not to scale.

The game can be played [here](https://parameterized.github.io/mass-from-orbits/).
